## How does this project's versions match axe-core versions?

Every time axe-core gets a major/minor/patch upgrade, this project also gets a major/minor/patch upgrade. But this project can also have upgrades unrelated to axe-core, which follow semantic versioning. As a result, this project's versions will not match axe-core versions exactly. Refer to [package-lock.json](./assets/package-lock.json) to learn the exact axe-core version currently used, or read the changelog.
